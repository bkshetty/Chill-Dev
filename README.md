## 🚀 Getting Started (For Beginners)

This guide will walk you through setting up the project from scratch, even if you're new to web development!

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have these installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Check installation: Open terminal/command prompt and type `node --version`
   - Should show something like: `v16.x.x` or higher

2. **Git** (for version control)
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/
   - Check installation: Type `git --version`
   - Should show: `git version 2.x.x`

3. **Code Editor** (recommended: VS Code)
   - Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

4. **Firebase Account** (free)
   - Sign up at: https://console.firebase.google.com/

5. **Google Cloud Account** (free tier)
   - Sign up at: https://console.cloud.google.com/

### 📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DZ1shetty/Chill-Dev.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd Chill-Dev

# Open in VS Code (optional)
code .
```

### 📦 Step 2: Install Dependencies

In the terminal (make sure you're in the project folder):

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all required packages. It might take a few minutes.

### 🔥 Step 3: Firebase Setup (Detailed)

#### 3.1 Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click **"Add project"** or **"Create a project"**
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "safe-route-app")
4. (Optional) Disable Google Analytics if you don't need it
5. Click **"Create project"** and wait for it to finish

#### 3.2 Enable Authentication

1. In your Firebase project, click **"Authentication"** from the left sidebar
2. Click **"Get started"** button
3. Go to **"Sign-in method"** tab
4. Enable **"Email/Password"**:
   - Click on Email/Password
   - Toggle the first switch to "Enabled"
   - Click "Save"
5. Enable **"Google"**:
   - Click on Google
   - Toggle to "Enabled"
   - Select a support email
   - Click "Save"

#### 3.3 Create Firestore Database

1. Click **"Firestore Database"** from the left sidebar
2. Click **"Create database"** button
3. Choose **"Start in production mode"** (we'll add security rules later)
4. Select a location (choose closest to your users)
5. Click **"Enable"**

#### 3.4 Enable Firebase Storage

1. Click **"Storage"** from the left sidebar
2. Click **"Get started"**
3. Click **"Next"** (keep default rules)
4. Choose same location as Firestore
5. Click **"Done"**

#### 3.5 Get Firebase Configuration

1. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to "Project Overview"
2. Click **"Project settings"**
3. Scroll down to **"Your apps"** section
4. Click the **"</>"** (Web) icon
5. Register your app:
   - App nickname: "Safe Route Web App"
   - Check "Also set up Firebase Hosting" (optional)
   - Click "Register app"
6. **IMPORTANT**: Copy all the config values (you'll need these in Step 5)
   - apiKey
   - authDomain
   - projectId
   - storageBucket
   - messagingSenderId
   - appId
   - measurementId

### 🗺️ Step 4: Google Maps Setup (Detailed)

#### 4.1 Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click **"Select a project"** at the top
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Enter project name (e.g., "safe-route-maps")
5. Click **"Create"**

#### 4.2 Enable Required APIs

1. In the search bar, type **"Maps JavaScript API"**
2. Click on it and click **"Enable"**
3. Go back and search for **"Places API"**
4. Click on it and click **"Enable"**
5. Search for **"Geocoding API"** and enable it too

#### 4.3 Create API Key

1. Go to **"Credentials"** from the left sidebar
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** → **"API key"**
3. Copy the API key (you'll need this in Step 5)
4. Click **"Restrict Key"** (recommended for security)

#### 4.4 Restrict API Key (Recommended)

1. Under **"Application restrictions"**:
   - Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
   - Add: `localhost:3000/*` (for development)
   - Add your production domain later
2. Under **"API restrictions"**:
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Select: Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Geocoding API
3. Click **"Save"**

#### 4.5 Enable Billing (Required for Google Maps)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Google Maps requires a billing account, but it has a generous free tier ($200 credit/month)

1. Go to **"Billing"** from the main menu
2. Click **"Link a billing account"**
3. Follow the steps to add a credit card
4. Don't worry - you won't be charged unless you exceed the free tier (unlikely for development)

### 🔐 Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

This is the most important step! We'll create a file to store your API keys securely.

#### 5.1 Create Environment File

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

**Mac/Linux (Terminal):**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Or manually**: Just duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`

#### 5.2 Add Your API Keys

Open the `.env` file in your code editor and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# Google Maps API Key (from Step 4)
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyA... (paste your Google Maps API key here)

# Firebase Configuration (from Step 3)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyB... (paste from Firebase config)
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123def456
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

#### 5.3 Save and Verify

1. **Save** the `.env` file
2. **IMPORTANT**: Never share this file or commit it to Git!
3. The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` so it won't be uploaded

📖 **Need more help?** See detailed guide: [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md)

⚠️ **Security Note**: Your `.env` file contains sensitive keys. Keep it private!

### 🔒 Step 6: Deploy Security Rules

Security rules protect your database from unauthorized access.

#### 6.1 Install Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

#### 6.2 Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

This will open a browser window. Sign in with your Google account.

#### 6.3 Initialize Firebase

```bash
firebase init
```

When prompted:
- Select **"Firestore"** and **"Storage"** (use spacebar to select)
- Choose **"Use an existing project"**
- Select your project from the list
- Accept default file names (press Enter)
- **Don't overwrite** existing files (type `N` if asked)

#### 6.4 Deploy Rules

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```

✅ Your database is now secured!

### 🎉 Step 7: Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
VITE v4.5.14  ready in 180 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
➜  Network: http://192.168.x.x:3000/
```

**Open your browser** and go to: http://localhost:3000

🎊 **Congratulations!** Your app should now be running!

### 🧪 Step 8: Test the Application

1. **Sign Up**: Create a new account with email/password
2. **Login**: Sign in with your new account
3. **View Map**: Click on "Map" to see the interactive safety map
4. **Add Report**: Click anywhere on the map to add a safety report
5. **View Reports**: Go to "My Reports" to see your submissions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Missing required Firebase configuration"
**Solution**: Make sure your `.env` file exists and contains all required variables.
```bash
# Check if .env file exists
ls -la | grep .env

# If missing, copy from example
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Issue: "Maps not loading"
**Solutions**:
1. Check if Google Maps API key is correct in `.env`
2. Verify Maps JavaScript API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Check if billing is enabled (required for Maps API)
4. Clear browser cache and reload

#### Issue: "Firebase permission denied"
**Solutions**:
1. Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. Make sure you're logged in: Check top-right corner of the app
3. Verify your account is marked as verified in Firestore

#### Issue: "npm install fails"
**Solutions**:
1. Delete `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`
2. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Make sure you have Node.js v16 or higher

#### Issue: "Port 3000 already in use"
**Solutions**:
- The dev server is already running in another terminal
- Kill the process and restart: `npx kill-port 3000`
- Or use a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3001`

#### Issue: "Cannot connect to Firebase"
**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Firebase project is active
3. Check if billing is enabled for Firebase
4. Review `.env` file for typos in configuration
